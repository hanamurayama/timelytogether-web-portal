TimelyTogether is a thesis project exploring gentle, emotionally supportive scheduling and reminders between older adults and their family members. This repository contains a functional web portal prototype used to create and send reminders to a shared home display.

## Project Overview

TimelyTogether was inspired by personal family experiences and research into how older adults and family members experience support, autonomy, and connection in daily routines.
Rather than focusing on alerts or productivity, the project explores how reminders can feel **calm, respectful, and emotionally affirming**, especially in shared family contexts.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository contains a **frontend-focused prototype** of the TimelyTogether web portal.

The project was originally developed and fully functional within a Replit environment, where the web portal was connected to a companion home display and capable of sending live reminders.

For the purposes of public sharing and deployment via GitHub Pages, this repository presents a **UI and interaction prototype**:
- The interface and user flow are fully implemented
- Buttons and interactions are functional
- Backend communication to the physical home display is not active in this version

This approach allows the design, structure, and interaction intent of the system to be shared publicly, while preserving the original prototype context.
